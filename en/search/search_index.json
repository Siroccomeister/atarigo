Then we still roll-up our sleeves and plan our todo actions for the day and work hard on getting things done.  Yet at the end of your day, your todo list probably has still grown despite your closed actions. Your stress level probably as well. Sounds familiar as a stage setting (I could drag on a lot more on this)?</p> <p>So as we navigate together in these waters, the question I ask myself is : am I really progressing?</p> <p> </p> <p>Say I am in the desert, on my way to Promised Land, returning to Egypt is not an option. My direction is clear. And yet : how can I assess my progress and feel satisfied? As nothing resembles more to a sand dune than another sand dune, am I not falling back on my path?</p> <p>Now of course, some days are special. They might be highlights such as anniversaries or successes. They will stand-out and you could say that achieving those outcomes are real proof points of your progress. You might even get compensated for those. But those might be what (...) 10-20 days in a year? That still leaves you with ~340 days.</p> <p>And while we may have our directions, work with objectives agreed professionally with management (or privately with your spouse), I started wondering what I could do myself to get a better sense of my own steps, what\u2019s in there for me? Not so much about getting things done, but a lot more of what have I learned today and what difference did I made and how did I develop myself? How about increasing the cadence on those.</p> <p>Because it might be that you\u2019re turning in circles, going backwards, or feel lost. Some days will feel like failures. And if this is the case, your resilience might be at stake when your next hurdle or challenge shows up. Your energy is getting drowned, step-by-step.</p> <p>Human Resources are quite conscious of this. I have seen good initiatives all aiming at strengthening the feedback given to employees, increasing the cadence of exchanges, developing communities, synergies. Improving the quality time. But do you really aspire to let your work experience define your personal development? You cannot always rely on others to motivate you (leaders, managers). It might help, but will unlikely be fulfilling.</p> <p>Another option are social networks. You may chase likes on LinkedIn or Strava or Instagram. And the more likes you get, the more rewarded you feel. But again, whilst the feedback from others matters, is this defining your own steps and your progress? I leave the question open as being personal, but in my case, it does not.</p> <p>So I decided to start an experiment. I chose to write down my learnings. I started journaling them. Publicly and in all transparency. And each of my posts shall describe the size of the steps I leave behind me in the sand... am curious what my pathway will look like !</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/post2/","title":"7 seconds","text":""},{"location":"blog/post2/#7-seconds","title":"7 seconds","text":"<p>Active listening, empathetic speech, the first 7 seconds, uncertainty reduction theory: a quick internet search triggered numerous content about effective communication in the first moments of a discussion.</p> <p>And I often ask myself how to improve my communication when I address an audience or a person.</p> <p>The topic matters to me because during my recent bike trip, I learnt that encounters could be such intense highlights. Loaded with empathy and amazingly spontaneous camaraderie. This made me wonder how to keep the experience in a much wider context. And not limited to a 40 day solo trip on a bike to cross the United States southbound.</p> <p></p> <p>So what can I do to strengthen those first moments? Noting that I am rather inclined towards being an introvert, quite rational with limited charisma.</p> <ol> <li>Connect to my audience ; the first moments, non-verbal communication is there. So you should have an honest stance, self-awareness that signals trust. And also have high consideration for your audience.</li> <li>The mirroring effect : in your opening and on your key messages, the audience will - consciously or not - imagine how your message applies to themselves. This will either distance them (they don't feel relevance) or raise their interest (they are able to identify themselves to your saying).</li> <li>Be aware of your intended relationship / role play : are you a teacher or the expert (you have knowledge they don't have), are you a manager (you decide they execute), are you a friend (you are there to help them), are you a resource (they want something from you), are you a father (you want to protect them). A simple way to handle this could also be the \"triangle\" of the good, the bad, the victim. </li> <li>Chose a Drumbeat : avoid by all means a long monotonous speech. Inject tone, colour, silence, antagonisms, open questions. You can actually also cycle repetitively across the above points. And make use of the 5 \"C\" in your approach as you do it (Courage, Curiosity, Creativity, Confidence, Collaboration) which are great ways to share and connect emotionally with others.</li> <li>Be prepared : all situations are not alike. It's not one truth for all situations. So I think it is a good practice to step back and establish those points above, have your defined opinions and stance sort of organised. And also reflect in hindsight if it worked (but it's good if you diverge!). Don't hesitate to experiment.</li> </ol> <p>If you want to feel inspired by great communicators, look-up a speech of Martin Luther King or have fun with Jandro or Dani Daortiz when they do their magic trick at Penn&amp;Teller's.

What's behind Ethical Leadership and how does it help building bridges.</p> <p>Well, in a world of daily uncertainties echoed as \u2014geopolitical tensions, nationalist movements, technological disruption, and climate change\u2014 I wanted to shift my views about society and the actions I take. </p> <p>Driving by \u201cethics\u201d might actually sound outdated or tied to rigid traditions. However, ethical leadership today is about much more than clinging to the past; it\u2019s about inspiring positive change, trust, and innovation in an unsettled world. And I think building bridges are a nice illustration of architecting change with such ethics in mind.</p> <p></p> <p>Here\u2019s how ethical leadership can articulate a fresh, visionary, energizing force.</p> <p>Ethical leadership as a catalyst for innovation and progress</p> <p>By placing people above profits and making decisions transparently and fairly, ethical leaders foster trust, psychological safety, and a culture where diverse perspectives and creative ideas can thrive. This environment accelerates innovation \u2014even \u201cbootlegging\u201d or grassroots innovation among employees\u2014 because people feel empowered to take responsible risks and think boldly.</p> <p>Modern ethical leadership rooted in openness\u2014not dogma.</p> <p>The best leaders today don\u2019t have all the answers. They are curious, adaptable, and eager to learn from others. Open-minded ethical leaders nurture inclusivity, listen actively, embrace new approaches (including AI and digital transformation), and build cultures where experimentation is encouraged and failure is seen as an opportunity to grow. This is the opposite of being close-minded or stuck in the past.</p> <p>Ethical leadership is inseparable from resilience and long-term success.</p> <p>In turbulent times, trust and credibility are critical. Ethical leaders stand as beacons of integrity, guiding teams and organizations through uncertainty by remaining true to a core set of values\u2014compassion, fairness, accountability, and transparency. This stabilizes teams and enables organizations not only to survive crises, but to build sustainable future success.</p> <p>Ethics for a changing world.</p> <p>When the ground shifts rapidly, ethical leadership ensures that change benefits not just organizations but also communities and society. It turns progress\u2014from global trade shifts to AI\u2014into something inclusive, responsible, and empowering, rather than divisive or exploitative. Ethical leaders ask, \u201cHow can this change improve lives for all and serve the greater good?\u201d.</p> <p>Finally here are the 5Cs that trigger my enthusiasm and help me build such valuable bridges : </p> <ul> <li>Inspire with Confidence, </li> <li>Lead with Courage,</li> <li>Drive by Commitment, </li> <li>Innovate with Creativity</li> <li>Unite with Collaboration.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/post4/","title":"Shifting gears","text":""},{"location":"blog/post4/#shifting-gears","title":"Shifting gears","text":"<p>Last week has been an eye-opener for me as I watched the speeches at the french Parliament. I was trying to make sense of the statements issued by the departing prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.</p> <p>In a nutshell, he was claiming that France was put into the corner or nearing the cliffs, as the debt financing was only going to grow (above \u20ac100B by 2030) while France nation was able to create net resource of \u20ac50B. What was the meaning of these numbers and why such a drama with a downwards spiral for France legacy and future generations?. I started to go into fact checking mode and with the help of some AI (Perplexity), refreshed basic economic terms. This post outlines those resulting key aspects.</p> <p>post written with research and charting through AI Perplexity</p> <p>While the AI Perplexity was researching source date from the web (Statista, https://tradingeconomics.com , ECB and Banque de France), I have not verified detailed numbers. But the groundwork is useful if you want to understand what's driving a state budget situation at national level. Then again, I did struggle a bit to get the charts and graphs perfect and typically resolved to export and finalise in Excel myself.</p> <p></p>  Should we not seriously envisage shifting gears downwards? <p>So I wanted to a) understand the issue and b) run some fact checking against it. After doing some research and rework somewhat my basics in economics, I understood that :</p> <p>France does have a national budget with a deficit. In itself not uncommon. But :</p> <ul> <li>France also has a significant debt : currently close to 120% of its annual GDP (Gross). As a means to compare, the rule in Eurozone is to limit it at 60% (which Germany for instance does). Accordingly, France belongs to the most indebted countries (thinking of Italy, Japan and USA here).</li> <li>The financing of the debt, which is a key responsibility of any government is under pressure. The interest rates (yield) are specific to each country and best represented by the 10 year mark. But fact is those rates have increased over the last 10 years for France. We are in the range of \u20ac50B and the forecast (as new debt needs to be contracted at a higher rate and interests be paid) by 2030 is more than double.</li> </ul> <p>So : budget has a significant deficit (-5% whilst the rule for Eurozone is max -3%), the debt itself is overwhelming and the debt financing will significantly grow. All ingredients for a negative downturn spiral are present.</p> <p></p> <p>Favorable interest rate trends cede place to steep increase, with a plateau expected near 3.5% 10 Year yield</p> <p>The chart visualizes the marked downward trend in French sovereign rates from above 5% in 2000 to near zero by 2020, followed by a sharp upturn after 2020 in response to inflation and rate hikes. The period 2020\u20132023 sees a reversal, with yields climbing from negative territory to above 3% in 2023, reflecting changing global economic and monetary conditions.</p> <p>So fine, the situation is getting tense with interest rates going up and financing as well. But most countries do have a deficit in their budgets, so why is it an issue for France?</p> <p></p> <p>How France GDP YoY growth compensates primary budget balance (ie. before paying debt interest rates).  </p> <p>As the chart illustrates, GDP annual growth  coverage of primary budget balance (so the balance of budget before the pay-out of all due debt interests) is hardly above the 50B\u20ac mark as Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou mentioned. Whilst the debt financing (so the amount to pay to sovereign obligations subscribers ) is seen to increase above 100B\u20ac due to the interest rates increasing. This leads to a net decrease in value for the nation : you're consuming more than you're able to produce in value.</p> <p></p> <p>A simple explanation of debt dynamics. </p> <p>But the combined effect of all those dynamics and trends is shown in this last chart. Here you can really see the actuals of the debt-to-GDP ratio (increasing linear graph in %) as well as the year-on-year variation  (red bars signal a year-on-year declining ratio measured in points of %).</p> <p></p> <p>The increasing Debt-to-GDP graph is really worrying, starting at 60% to aim at 120% by 2030, </p> <p>Indeed the combination of a) GDP limited growth coverage and b) interest rate increase drives  yield  and debt  inflation, deteriorating the debt-to-GDP ratio consistently (between 3 and 4 points, see red bars).  Resulting total debt increases faster than GDP. 2030 outlook shows debt interests &gt;100B\u20ac, and debt-to-GDP ratio &gt;120% (vs. Eurozone target of 60%). A strong fiscal stress for the 7th global and 2nd Eurozone economy by nominal GDP.</p>"},{"location":"blog/post4/#drawing-some-first-conclusions","title":"Drawing some first conclusions","text":"<p>Well, there's probably more to say in a few more posts. My current assessment is that the situation is indeed serious and that France politicians should definitely also embrace a longer term outlook in terms of policy. The place of the 2nd Eurozone nation by nominal size is not exactly pretty. We need strong enconomists in France !</p> <p>Then again, everything gets compared to the size of an annual GDP - which is what the country is able to generate in value - within a year. This is big, but then again, it is only a one year measure. France is a large and resourceful country.</p> <p>And as I will dig into in a few other posts, France also has very strong positions. First of all, its social system (whilst a limiting factor in terms of reform flexibility) and strong large administration, allows for a good redistribution of national goods and protects the low revenue segments. Furthermore, in case of ponctual crisis (subprimes and COVID), this system demonstrated a good resilience.</p> <p>Conversely, one should not ignore the high debt, the high taxes on enterprises, the difficulty to drive future-proof reforms, the reducing purchasing power. Clearly, France does not withstand well the comparison with other European key countries.</p> <p>So : one can only hope that vision, peace but also a lucid reality check will drive gear shifting to find the appropriate pace \ud83d\ude4f.</p> <p>How about other countries ? Well I invite you to look at your own country's situation. On my side, I did also check Germany, USA, Switzerland and am trying to create a simple dashboard to keep up. I do suspect this is wise practice given times ahead.</p>"}]}
