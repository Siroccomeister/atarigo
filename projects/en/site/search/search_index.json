I had bought a gravel 6 month before and thought by myself : I'd love to undertake such an adventure (bucket list type of idea). In fact, I started planning ahead that if nothing would prevent it, I would actually do it. And here I am now!</p> <p>One year later, many things happened and made it actually possible. Including taking a sabbatical, leaving a long time employer and preparing for a new professional/career step, family and supportive friends, physical preparation... long list. But encouraging list.</p>"},{"location":"#why-this-blog","title":"Why this blog","text":"<p>Originally I did not mean to maintain a blog. But many asked how to follow me. And I also wanted to capture my daily moments, consolidate my experiences, elaborate on inspirations. I alsoi wanted to give back and inspire others.</p> <p>So I decided to create this dedicated website. And as a promoter of open source, running it on GitHub was a nicer option than resolving to use made-for platforms (Wordpress, PolarStep), as good as they may be. This flexibility also allows me to design it in a way that makes it also useful to myself \ud83d\ude09.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/day0/","title":"Day 0 - Take-off","text":""},{"location":"blog/day0/#day-0-take-off","title":"Day 0 - Take-off","text":"<p>Buckle-up! It's getting serious. Biggest learning of the day: don't plan too much ahead, let the way guide you as well.</p> <p>After a stressful packing, it finally had a happy end, and check-in went fine once at Geneva airport. Close though (400g left out of 23Kg allowance) \u2696\ufe0f.</p> <p>With Val\u00e9rie we could then enjoy some quality time (incl. a nice cappuccino with a nice drawing on it \u2764\ufe0f).</p> <p>I also was able to enjoy Z\u00fcrich Kloten airport a bit longer: connection to Calgary got delayed by 1h30. Hello terrasse \u2615\ufe0f again.</p> <p>Then I learned that Jasper is in flames. Terrible news, apparently the fire is in the city \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. It's been too hot: 40 degrees Celsius. Jasper national park is closed, the famous Icefields Parkway between Lake Louise/Banff and Jasper is also closed midway. Well - I was planning to start from Jasper... \ud83e\uddd0 what now?</p> <p>Let's see once in Calgary. I envisage first unboxing/gearing up the bike and taking a room close to Calgary airport. I also saw that the Trans-Canadian Trail (TCT) could take me to Banff. And probably I would then head south... leaving the parkway 93 behind me and hoping the fire will be under control soon though.</p> <p>Update: the news for Jasper made it home. I am definitely going to head to Banff. Quite sad about the devastation...</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"}]}
