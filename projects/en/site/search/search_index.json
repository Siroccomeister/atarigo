Then we still roll-up our sleeves and plan our todo actions for the day and work hard on getting things done.  Yet at the end of your day, your todo list probably has still grown despite your closed actions. Your stress level probably as well. Sounds familiar as a stage setting (I could drag on a lot more on this)?</p> <p>So as we navigate together in these waters, the question I ask myself is : am I really progressing?</p> <p> </p> <p>Say I am in the desert, on my way to Promised Land, returning to Egypt is not an option. My direction is clear. And yet : how can I assess my progress and feel satisfied? As nothing resembles more to a sand dune than another sand dune, am I not falling back on my path?</p> <p>Now of course, some days are special. They might be highlights such as anniversaries or successes. They will stand-out and you could say that achieving those outcomes are real proof points of your progress. You might even get compensated for those. But those might be what (...) 10-20 days in a year? That still leaves you with ~340 days.</p> <p>And while we may have our directions, work with objectives agreed professionally with management (or privately with your spouse), I started wondering what I could do myself to get a better sense of my own steps, what\u2019s in there for me? Not so much about getting things done, but a lot more of what have I learned today and what difference did I made and how did I develop myself? How about increasing the cadence on those.</p> <p>Because it might be that you\u2019re turning in circles, going backwards, or feel lost. Some days will feel like failures. And if this is the case, your resilience might be at stake when your next hurdle or challenge shows up. Your energy is getting drowned, step-by-step.</p> <p>Human Resources are quite conscious of this. I have seen good initiatives all aiming at strengthening the feedback given to employees, increasing the cadence of exchanges, developing communities, synergies. Improving the quality time. But do you really aspire to let your work experience define your personal development? You cannot always rely on others to motivate you (leaders, managers). It might help, but will unlikely be fulfilling.</p> <p>Another option are social networks. You may chase likes on LinkedIn or Strava or Instagram. And the more likes you get, the more rewarded you feel. But again, whilst the feedback from others matters, is this defining your own steps and your progress? I leave the question open as being personal, but in my case, it does not.</p> <p>So I decided to start an experiment. I chose to write down my learnings. I started journaling them. Publicly and in all transparency. And each of my posts shall describe the size of the steps I leave behind me in the sand... am curious what my pathway will look like !</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/post2/","title":"7 seconds","text":""},{"location":"blog/post2/#7-seconds","title":"7 seconds","text":"<p>Active listening, empathetic speech, the first 7 seconds, uncertainty reduction theory: a quick internet search triggered numerous content about effective communication in the first moments of a discussion.</p> <p>And I often ask myself how to improve my communication when I address an audience or a person.</p> <p>The topic matters to me because during my recent bike trip, I learnt that encounters could be such intense highlights. Loaded with empathy and amazingly spontaneous camaraderie. This made me wonder how to keep the experience in a much wider context. And not limited to a 40 day solo trip on a bike to cross the United States southbound.</p> <p></p> <p>So what can I do to strengthen those first moments? Noting that I am rather inclined towards being an introvert, quite rational with limited charisma.</p> <ol> <li>Connect to my audience ; the first moments, non-verbal communication is there. So you should have an honest stance, self-awareness that signals trust. And also have high consideration for your audience.</li> <li>The mirroring effect : in your opening and on your key messages, the audience will - consciously or not - imagine how your message applies to themselves. This will either distance them (they don't feel relevance) or raise their interest (they are able to identify themselves to your saying).</li> <li>Be aware of your intended relationship / role play : are you a teacher or the expert (you have knowledge they don't have), are you a manager (you decide they execute), are you a friend (you are there to help them), are you a resource (they want something from you), are you a father (you want to protect them). A simple way to handle this could also be the \"triangle\" of the good, the bad, the victim. </li> <li>Chose a Drumbeat : avoid by all means a long monotonous speech. Inject tone, colour, silence, antagonisms, open questions. You can actually also cycle repetitively across the above points. And make use of the 5 \"C\" in your approach as you do it (Courage, Curiosity, Creativity, Confidence, Collaboration) which are great ways to share and connect emotionally with others.</li> <li>Be prepared : all situations are not alike. It's not one truth for all situations. So I think it is a good practice to step back and establish those points above, have your defined opinions and stance sort of organised. And also reflect in hindsight if it worked (but it's good if you diverge!). Don't hesitate to experiment.</li> </ol> <p>If you want to feel inspired by great communicators, look-up a speech of Martin Luther King or have fun with Jandro or Dani Daortiz when they do their magic trick at Penn&amp;Teller's. If we could just use a tiny bit of their skills in our day-to-day communication - wouldn't that be fantastic ;^) (noting that this required lot's of practice and rehearsing...)</p> Jandro's magic with a smileMLK speech : what's your life blueprint?Dani has an amazing card trick <p></p> <p>Six months before he was assassinated, Martin Luther King spoke to a group of students at Barratt Junior High School in Philadelphia on October 26, 1967. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/post3/","title":"Ethical Leadership &amp; building bridges","text":""},{"location":"blog/post3/#ethical-leadership-building-bridges","title":"Ethical Leadership &amp; building bridges","text":"<p>I updated my LinkedIn profile with \u201cEthical Leader\u201d next to being a transformation architect, but what\u2019s implied with this choice of terminology and how does it sound forward-looking?</p> <p>Well, in a world of daily uncertainties echoed as \u2014geopolitical tensions, nationalist movements, technological disruption, and climate change\u2014 I wanted to shift my views about society and the actions I take. </p> <p>Driving by \u201cethics\u201d might actually sound outdated or tied to rigid traditions. However, ethical leadership today is about much more than clinging to the past; it\u2019s about inspiring positive change, trust, and innovation in an unsettled world. And I think building bridges are a nice illustration of architecting change with such ethics in mind.</p> <p></p> <p>Here\u2019s how ethical leadership can articulate a fresh, visionary, energizing force.</p> <p>Ethical leadership as a catalyst for innovation and progress</p> <p>By placing people above profits and making decisions transparently and fairly, ethical leaders foster trust, psychological safety, and a culture where diverse perspectives and creative ideas can thrive. This environment accelerates innovation \u2014even \u201cbootlegging\u201d or grassroots innovation among employees\u2014 because people feel empowered to take responsible risks and think boldly.</p> <p>Modern ethical leadership rooted in openness\u2014not dogma.</p> <p>The best leaders today don\u2019t have all the answers. They are curious, adaptable, and eager to learn from others. Open-minded ethical leaders nurture inclusivity, listen actively, embrace new approaches (including AI and digital transformation), and build cultures where experimentation is encouraged and failure is seen as an opportunity to grow. This is the opposite of being close-minded or stuck in the past.</p> <p>Ethical leadership is inseparable from resilience and long-term success.</p> <p>In turbulent times, trust and credibility are critical. Ethical leaders stand as beacons of integrity, guiding teams and organizations through uncertainty by remaining true to a core set of values\u2014compassion, fairness, accountability, and transparency. This stabilizes teams and enables organizations not only to survive crises, but to build sustainable future success.</p> <p>Ethics for a changing world.</p> <p>When the ground shifts rapidly, ethical leadership ensures that change benefits not just organizations but also communities and society. It turns progress\u2014from global trade shifts to AI\u2014into something inclusive, responsible, and empowering, rather than divisive or exploitative. Ethical leaders ask, \u201cHow can this change improve lives for all and serve the greater good?\u201d.</p> <p>Finally here are the 5Cs that trigger my enthusiasm and help me build such valuable bridges : </p> <ul> <li>Inspire with Confidence, </li> <li>Lead with Courage,</li> <li>Drive by Commitment, </li> <li>Innovate with Creativity</li> <li>Unite with Collaboration.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/category/personal-development/","title":"Personal Development","text":""}]}
